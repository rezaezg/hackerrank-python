The included code stub will read an integer,n , from STDIN.

Without using any string methods, try to print the following:

123...n
Note that "..." represents the consecutive values in between.

Example
n=5
Print the string 
12345


from __future__ import print_function
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        print(i,end='')
